To create an ECC curve, we'll use parametric equations. In the left panel, click on the "+" button to add a new item.
Select "Parametric Curve" from the dropdown menu.
You'll see three input fields for x(t), y(t), and z(t). For an ECC curve, we'll use something like this:
x(t) = t
y(t) = sqrt(t^3 + a*t + b)
z(t) = t^2
Where 'a' and 'b' are parameters of the elliptic curve.
Enter these equations into the respective fields. For example, you might use:
x(t) = t
y(t) = sqrt(t^3 - 3*t + 2)
z(t) = t^2
Adjust the domain of t if needed. By default, it might be set to [0, 2Ï€]. You can change this in the "Range" field below the equations.

To add more curves or points, you can click the "+" button again and repeat the process with different equations or parameters.
