Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Shamir's Secret Sharing for secure private key management.

In this solution:

We'll split the wallet's private key into multiple shares using Shamir's Secret Sharing.
MPC will ensure the secure management of shares and reconstruction only when a threshold is met.
The wallet will support basic operations like storing EVM tokens, signing transactions, and reconstructing the private key securely.

Assumptions:

We'll use the secp256k1 library for EVM private key and signature generation.
threshold_crypto crate for secret sharing (Shamirâ€™s Secret Sharing).
Support for EVM tokens, meaning storing balances for ERC-20 tokens and signing transactions.
